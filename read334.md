# Sendgrid

Twilio SendGrid account setup
Before sending your first email, you will need to complete the following Twilio SendGrid account setup. These requirements help secure your account and keep your messages from landing in spam folders.

Configure Two-factor authentication
Create an API key
Complete Sender Authentication

API keys
API Keys authenticate your application, mail client, or website with Twilio SendGrid services. Unlike a username and password, API keys are scoped to provide access only to the services you select. You can also delete and create API keys without impacting your other account credentials. For these reasons, Twilio SendGrid requires you to connect to its services using API keys.

Create an API key
In the Twilio SendGrid App, navigate to API Keys in the Settings menu, and select Create API Key.

# Payment Processing

It all starts with your bank checking account.  When you have that in place you will need a Merchant Account.  The Merchant Account is how you connect to the credit card processing network.  It is this account that makes sure credit cards are processed correctly and safely â€“ your bank account does not process credit cards.  Merchant Accounts accept (or decline) credit cards and ultimately transfer the funds into your bank account.  It visually makes sense if you think of the Merchant Account as the old card-swipe machine.

An Internet Merchant Account is a merchant account that is able to accept online credit card transactions.  Your Merchant Account may be such an account, or it may work in conjunction with your normal Merchant Account.  When setting up your Merchant Account you should ask if it is internet enabled and will work with the major Payment Gateways as discussed in the next section.
