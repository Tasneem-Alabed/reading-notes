# Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice

If you build software you program every day. That doesn't mean you get better at programming every day.

Improving your hard technical skills makes all the software you build better. It exposes you to new opportunities, expands your knowledge into multiple fields and ultimately allows you to do more things with computers.

It doesn't happen by accident. In this market, you will be rewarded handsomely for building one boring CRUD application after another. To upgrade your hard technical skills however, you'll need to apply deliberate practice.

The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:

Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
Repeated often
Feedback on results in continuously available
It's highly demanding mentally
It's difficult
It requires good goals

# The power of believing that you can improve

"Not Yet" give a chance to try again and try the chalenges and improve the skills and abilities.

# The power of passion and perseverance

what we need in education is a much better understanding of learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological perspective.
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality.

# A kinder, gentler philosophy of success

The dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery. You encounter it within minutes at a party, when you get asked that famous iconic question of the early 21st century, "What do you do?" According to how you answer that question, people are either incredibly delighted to see you, or look at their watch and make their excuses.
 but love in general, respect -- they are willing to accord us, that will be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy.
 And that's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about material goods. You know, we're often told that we live in very materialistic times, that we're all greedy people. I don't think we are particularly materialistic. I think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods. It's not the material goods we want; it's the rewards we want. It's a new way of looking at luxury goods. The next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari, don't think, "This is somebody who's greedy." Think, "This is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love."
