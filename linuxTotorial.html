        <h1>The Command Line - What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one.</h1>
        <p>graphical user interface ,The command line is an interesting beast, 

            Don't think of it as leaving the GUI behind so much as adding to it. While you can leave the GUI alltogether, most people open up a command line interface just as another window on their desktop (in fact you can have as many open as you like). This is also to our advantage as we can have several command lines open and doing different tasks in each at the same time. We can also easily jump back to the GUI when it suits us.
           A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

            <h1>Basic Navigation - An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it.</h1>
            <p>The first command  is pwd which stands for Print Working Directory. (You'll find that a lot of commands in linux are named as an abbreviation of a word or words describing them. This makes it easier to remember them.) The command does just that. It tells you what your current or present working directory is. Give it a try now.
                A lot of commands on the terminal will rely on you being in the right location. As you're moving around, it can be easy to lose track of where you are at. Make use of this command often so as to remind yourself where you presently are.Whereas pwd is just run by itself with no arguments, ls is a little more powerful. We have run it here with no arguments in which case it will just do a plain listing of our current location. 
                Whenever we refer to either a file or directory on the command line, we are in fact referring to a path. ie. A path is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system.

            <h1>More About Files - Find out some interesting characteristics of files and directories in a Linux environment.</h1>

            <p>Ok, the first thing we need to appreciate with linux is that under the hood, everything is actually a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file (one that the system reads from only), your monitor is a file (one that the system writes to only) etc. To begin with, this won't affect what we do too much but keep it in mind as it helps with understanding the behaviour of Linux as we manage files and directories.
                This is very important and a common source of problems for people new to Linux. Other systems such as Windows are case insensitive when it comes to referring to files. Linux is not like this. As such it is possible to have two or more files and directories with the same name but letters of different case.
                Spaces in file and directory names are perfectly valid but we need to be a little careful with them. As you would remember, a space on the command line is how we seperate items. They are how we know what is the program name and can identify each command line argument
                
                </p>
            <h1> Manual Pages - Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning.</h1>
            <p>
                they are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept. Some of them are a little hard to get your head around but they are fairly consistent in their structure so once you get the hang of it it's not too bad. 
A lot of being proficient at Linux is knowing which command line options we should use to modify the behaviour of our commands to suit our needs. A lot of these have both a long hand and short hand version. eg. Above you will notice that to list all directory entries (including hidden files) we can use the option -a or --all (remember from last section what files and directories beginning with a . are?). The long hand is really just a more human readable form. You may use either, they both do the same thing. One advantage of using long hand is that it can be easier for you to remember what your commands are doing. One advantage of using shorthand is that you can chain multiple together easier.

            <h1> File Manipulation - How to make, remove, rename, copy and move files and directories.</h1>
            <p>Linux organises it's file system in a hierarchical way. Over time you'll tend to build up a fair amount of data (storage capacities are always increasing). It's important that we create a directory structure that will help us organise that data in a manageable way. I've seen way too many people just dump everything directly at the base of their home directory and waste a lot of their time trying to find what they are after amongst 100's (or even 1000's) of other files. Develop the habit of organising your stuff into an elegant file structure now and you will thank yourself for years to come.
                mkdir
                Make Directory - ie. Create a directory.
                rmdir
                Remove Directory - ie. Delete a directory.
                touch
                Create a blank file.
                cp
                Copy - ie. Copy a file or directory.
                mv
                Move - ie. Move a file or directory (can also be used to rename).
                rm
                Remove - ie. Delete a file.</p>
