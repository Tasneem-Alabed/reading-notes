### Arrays
it is a structure of fixed-size can hold items of the same data type
Applications
1- building blocks to build other data structures
2-Used for different sorting algorithms

### Array List
sequential structure that consists of a sequence of items in linear order which are linked to each other 
                random access is not possible you have to access data sequentially 
Applications
1-Used for symbol table management in compiler design.
2-Used in switching between programs

### Stacks
A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out — the element placed at last can be accessed at first) 
Applications
1-Used for expression evaluation
2-Used to implement function calls in recursion programming

### Queues
A queue is a FIFO (First In First Out — the element placed at first can be accessed at first)
Applications
1-Used to manage threads in multithreading
2-Used to implement queuing systems

### Hash Tables
A Hash Table is a data structure that stores values which have keys associated with each of them. Furthermore, it supports lookup efficiently if we know the key associated with the value.
Applications
1-Used to implement database indexes.
2-Used to implement associative arrays
3-Used to implement the “set” data structure

### Trees
A tree is a hierarchical structure where data is organized hierarchically and are linked together. This structure is different from a linked list whereas, in a linked list, items are linked in a linear order
Applications
1-Binary Trees: Used to implement expression parsers and expression solvers
2-Heaps: used by JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to store Java objects
3-Treaps: used in wireless networking.

### Heaps
A Heap is a special case of a binary tree where the parent nodes are compared to their children with their values and are arranged accordingly.
Applications
1-Used in heapsort algorithm
2-Queue functions can be implemented using heaps within O(log n) time

### Graphs
A graph consists of a finite set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges connecting these vertices
Applications
1-Used to represent social media networks
2-Used to represent web pages and links by search engines

q1: the neture of the data and amount of it 
q2:The call stack is not an infinite resource. This is especially true when performing deep recursion. Functions calls within functions are placed on the call stack further up, which means each recursive call sits on the call stack, waiting to be executed.
    things i want to know more about it
    if thare anytime that we have to use the most complexity algorithm for any reason
