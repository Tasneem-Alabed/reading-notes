# Tutorial: Get started with EF Core in an ASP.NET MVC web app

This tutorial teaches ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework Core with controllers and views

ome things this MVC tutorial has that the Razor Pages tutorial doesn't:

Implement inheritance in the data model
Perform raw SQL queries
Use dynamic LINQ to simplify code
Some things the Razor Pages tutorial has that this one doesn't:

Use Select method to load related data
Best practices for EF.
The Contoso University sample web app demonstrates how to create an ASP.NET Core MVC web app using Entity Framework (EF) Core and Visual Studio.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial has not been updated for ASP.NET Core 6 or later. The tutorial's instructions will not work correctly if you create a project that targets ASP.NET Core 6 or 7. For example, the ASP.NET Core 6 and 7 web templates use the minimal hosting model, which unifies Startup.cs and Program.cs into a single Program.cs file.

## Database engines

The Visual Studio instructions use SQL Server LocalDB, a version of SQL Server Express that runs only on Windows.

## Solve problems and troubleshoot

If you run into a problem you can't resolve, you can generally find the solution by comparing your code to the completed project. For a list of common errors and how to solve them, see the Troubleshooting section of the last tutorial in the series. If you don't find what you need there, you can post a question to StackOverflow.com for ASP.NET
