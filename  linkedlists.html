        <h4>Big O used to describe the efficiency (Running time , memory space ) of an algorithem or function
            it discribe by worst case that algorithem that may take .</h4>
            <h5>there are 4 key to analyze the limitation are :</h5>
            <h6>input size :</h6>
            <p>Input Size refers to the size of the parameter values that are read by the algorithm. This does not simply refer to the number of parameters an algorithm reads, but takes into account the size of each parameter value as well.</p>
            <h6>units of measurment :</h6>
            <p>To evaluate a function for Time and Space complexity.</p>
            <p>There are three measurements to quantify the running time in analysis:</p>
              <p>  1-The time in milliseconds from the start of a function execution until it ends</p>
              <p>  2-The number of operation that are executed </p>
              <p>  3-Big o</p>
              <p>  There are four measurements to quantify the memory space in analysis:</p>
              <p> 1-The amount of space needed to hold the code for the algorithm</p>
              <p> 2-The amount of space needed to hold the input data</p>
              <p> 3-The amount of space needed for the output data.</p>
              <p>4-The amount of space needed to hold working space during the calculatio</p>
            <h6>order of growth :</h6>
            <p>As the value of input grows, the Order of Growth represents the increase in Running Time or Memory Space.</p>
            <h6>Best case , worst case , avareg case :</h6>
            <p>Best ccase:The efficiency for the best possible input of size n </p>
            <p>Worst Case: The efficiency for the worst possible input of size n</p>
            <p>Average Case: The efficiency for a “typical” or “random” input of size n.</p>
    
            <h4>Linked List :</h4>
            <p>it is a sequence of nodes that connected with each other.</p>
            <h5>Types of Linked list:</h5>
            <p> 1-Singly Linked list :singel way from node to other you can go to next but con not back to prev</p>
            <p> 2-Doubly Linked list : two wayes from node to other enable to go next and prev.</p>
