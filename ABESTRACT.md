# Object-Oriented programming (C#)

 basic principles of object-oriented language :
        Encapsulation Hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and only allowing access through a public set of functions.
        Abstraction Modeling
        Inheritance Polymorphism Ability to implement inherited properties or methods in different ways across multiple abstractions

# Abstract :

An abstract class cannot be instantiated. The purpose of an abstract class is to provide a common definition of a base class that multiple derived classes can share. 
        Abstract methods have no implementation, so the method definition is followed by a semicolon instead of a normal method block. Derived classes of the abstract class must implement all abstract methods. 
    
# Polymorphism:

Polymorphism is often referred to as the third pillar of object-oriented programming, after encapsulation and inheritance. Virtual methods enable you to work with groups of related objects in a uniform way.
