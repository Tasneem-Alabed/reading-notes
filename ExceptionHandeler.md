## How to debug for absolute beginners

 Debugger, unfortunately, isn’t something that can magically reveal all the problems or “bugs” in our code. Debugging means to run your code step by step in a debugging tool like Visual Studio, to find the exact point where you made a programming mistake. You then understand what corrections you need to make in your code and debugging tools often allow you to make temporary changes so you can continue running the program.

 Using a debugger effectively is also a skill that takes time and practice to learn but is ultimately a fundamental task for every software developer. In this article, we introduce the core principles of debugging and provide tips to get you started.

 By using the Call Stack window, you can view the function or procedure calls that are currently on the stack. The Call Stack window shows the order in which methods and functions are getting called. The call stack is a good way to examine and understand the execution flow of an app

## Statement keywords (C# Reference)

Statements are program instructions. Except as described in the topics referenced in the following table, statements are executed in sequence. The following table lists the C# statement keywords. For more information about statements that are not expressed with any keyword.

The underlying cause is attributed to poor software design and development practices. Atomic Energy Canada, Ltd. has not independently reviewed the software code. It has not considered the software design in its assessment of how the device works, whether it might lead to the intended results, and whether ways of failing exist.

## Therac-25
The Canadian Atomic Energy Limited personnel, as well as the machinery operators, initially did not believe the complaints. This was most likely due to overconfidence, the personnel of Atomic Energy Canada Limited had never tested Therac-25 with the combination of software and hardware until it was assembled at the hospital. The failure occurs when a certain non-standard sequence of keystrokes has been entered. This sequence of keystrokes was improbable, and because the problem does not occur very often it went unnoticed for a long time.
