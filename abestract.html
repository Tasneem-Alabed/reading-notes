       <h1>Object-Oriented programming (C#):</h1> 
       <p>
        basic principles of object-oriented language :
        Encapsulation Hiding the internal state and functionality of an object and only allowing access through a public set of functions.
        Abstraction Modeling
        Inheritance 
        Polymorphism Ability to implement inherited properties or methods in different ways across multiple abstractions.</p>
        
        <h1>Abstract :</h1>
        <p>An abstract class cannot be instantiated. The purpose of an abstract class is to provide a common definition of a base class that multiple derived classes can share. 
        Abstract methods have no implementation, so the method definition is followed by a semicolon instead of a normal method block. Derived classes of the abstract class must implement all abstract methods. 
    </p>
       <h1> Polymorphism:</h1>
        <p>Polymorphism is often referred to as the third pillar of object-oriented programming, after encapsulation and inheritance. 
        Virtual methods enable you to work with groups of related objects in a uniform way.
